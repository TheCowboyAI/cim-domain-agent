# Bevy 3D Chat Interface Features

## Overview
Created a beautiful 3D visualization with integrated AI chat interface that combines:
- Enhanced 3D scene from our previous work
- Real-time chat panel on the right side
- AI integration for conversational analysis
- Interactive keyboard controls

## Key Features

### 3D Visualization
1. **Domain-Specific Node Shapes**
   - Person: Sphere (green)
   - Organization: Cube (blue)
   - Policy: Cylinder (yellow)
   - Location: Torus (red)
   - AI Agent: Capsule (purple)

2. **Enhanced Lighting**
   - Ambient lighting with cool tones
   - Directional light with shadows
   - Emissive materials for glow effects

3. **Animations**
   - Rotating nodes
   - Floating motion with unique frequencies
   - Subtle ambient light pulsing

### Chat Interface
1. **Chat Panel (Right Side)**
   - Semi-transparent background
   - Scrollable message history
   - Color-coded messages (User: green, AI: blue, System: gray)
   - Input field at bottom

2. **Keyboard Controls**
   - Type messages directly
   - Enter to send
   - Backspace to delete
   - ESC to quit

3. **Special Commands**
   - `analyze` - Full graph analysis
   - `nodes` - List all nodes
   - `edges` - Show relationships

### AI Integration
1. **Multi-Provider Support**
   - Automatically detects Claude (Anthropic)
   - Falls back to OpenAI
   - Mock provider if no API keys

2. **Async Communication**
   - Non-blocking AI requests
   - Background thread for API calls
   - Real-time response updates

3. **Context-Aware Responses**
   - AI knows about the graph structure
   - Provides domain-specific insights
   - Conversational interaction style

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Bevy ECS** for 3D rendering and UI
- **Crossbeam channels** for async-sync bridge
- **Tokio runtime** in background thread for AI calls
- **Resource-based state management**

### Key Components
```rust
ChatState - Manages conversation history
AIChannels - Handles async communication
GraphResource - Stores graph data and AI provider
ChatUI components - UI entity markers
```

### Usage
```bash
# Set API key (Claude or OpenAI)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Run the demo
cargo run --package cim-domain-agent --example bevy_3d_chat_interface --features "all-ai-providers"
```

## Improvements Over Previous Versions
1. **Integrated Chat** - No need to switch between terminal and 3D view
2. **Better UI Layout** - Chat panel doesn't obstruct 3D scene
3. **Real-time Updates** - See AI responses as they arrive
4. **Professional Appearance** - Semi-transparent panels, good typography
5. **Keyboard-First** - Natural typing experience

## Future Enhancements
- Click on nodes to ask about them
- Voice input/output
- Multiple chat sessions
- Export conversation history
- More graph interaction commands
