# Enhanced 3D Demo Features

## Visual Enhancements Added to CIM 3D Graph Demo

### Animation Systems

1. **Floating Nodes**
   - Nodes gently float up and down with sine wave motion
   - Each node has a unique frequency and phase for organic movement
   - Amplitude of 0.3 units for subtle but noticeable effect

2. **Pulsing Nodes**
   - Nodes pulse in size with smooth scaling
   - Base scale preserved with 5% amplitude variation
   - Creates a "breathing" effect that draws attention

3. **Particle Effects**
   - AI Agent and Policy nodes emit particles
   - Particles have upward bias with random directional spread
   - Gravity affects particles for realistic motion
   - Particles fade out over 3-second lifetime
   - Color-matched to node type for visual coherence

### Lighting Improvements

1. **Multi-Light Setup**
   - Primary directional light with warm tone (20,000 lux)
   - Secondary fill light with cool tone (5,000 lux)
   - Blue accent point light (4,000 intensity)
   - Warm accent point light (3,000 intensity)
   - Enhanced ambient light with blue tint

2. **Material Enhancements**
   - Domain-specific metallic values (Organizations more metallic)
   - Varied roughness per domain type
   - Emissive properties for glowing effects
   - Proper alpha blending for transparency

### Visual Polish

1. **Ground Plane Grid**
   - Stylized grid pattern on ground
   - Semi-transparent grid lines with emissive glow
   - 60x60 unit ground plane for spacious feel

2. **Edge Visualization**
   - Relationship-based edge coloring
   - Arrow heads showing direction
   - Animated emissive pulsing on edges
   - Different colors for different relationships:
     - "leads" → Golden
     - "works_for" → Blue
     - "applies_to" → Red
     - "located_at" → Green
     - "assists" → Purple

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Gradient backgrounds with transparency
   - Border highlights on UI panels
   - Better text hierarchy with subtitles
   - Professional color scheme

### Camera Features

1. **Enhanced Camera Controller**
   - Smooth orbital camera motion
   - Zoom controls (+/- keys)
   - Rotation controls (arrow keys)
   - Height adjustment (up/down arrows)
   - Reset camera position (R key)

2. **MSAA Anti-aliasing**
   - 4x multisampling for smooth edges
   - Reduces jaggies on 3D objects

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Particle System**
   - Pooled mesh instances
   - Automatic despawn when lifetime expires
   - Controlled spawn rates

2. **Smart Animation Updates**
   - Delta time-based animations
   - Smooth frame-independent motion

## Controls

- **SPACE**: Analyze graph with AI
- **R**: Reset camera position
- **+/-**: Zoom in/out
- **←→**: Rotate camera around scene
- **↑↓**: Adjust camera height
- **Q/ESC**: Quit application

## Technical Details

- Uses Bevy 0.16 with modern ECS patterns
- Async AI integration with thread-safe channels
- Domain-driven design with proper separation
- Event-driven architecture for AI analysis

The demo now provides a production-quality 3D visualization with professional graphics, smooth animations, and engaging visual effects that make the CIM domain relationships come alive.
